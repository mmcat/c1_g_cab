# Quick Start
- Create a python virtual environment either by [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/).
- Download the package and decompress it.
  - please download it from [github](https://github.com/mmcat/c1_g_cab)
    - `git clone https://github.com/mmcat/c1_g_cab`
    - `cd c1_g_cab`
  - decompress the dataset with new features for saving running time.
    - `tar -xzvf datasets/data_with_new_features.tar.gz`
  - you can also review the results from [here](https://github.com/mmcat/c1_g_cab/blob/master/nyc_green_taxi_09_2015.ipynb)
- Install dependencies in your created virtual environment
  - `pip install -r requirement.txt`
- Run the notebook
  - `jupyter notebook`
